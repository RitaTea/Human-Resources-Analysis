# Human-Resources-Analysis

This project was a deep dive into the employee database of a company, exploring various aspects of its workforce.  I started by getting familiar with the data, looking at the different tables and their structures, like getting to know the characters in a story.  Then, I began asking questions.  I wanted to know the gender balance of the company, how many employees were in each department, and what the salary ranges looked like.  I even looked at how long employees' salary contracts were and how hiring trends had changed over time.

I also wanted to see if there were any patterns in salaries, like if there was a difference in average salary between men and women in the same department.  And I tried to find out who was hired in a specific year, like 2000.  To make things more efficient, I created a stored procedure, a bit like a mini-program, to easily retrieve an employee's last department.  I also set up a trigger, a kind of automatic rule, to make sure that no one could be hired in the future â€“ their hire date had to be today or in the past.

Then, I used some advanced techniques called window functions to analyze salaries in more detail.  I wanted to see how each employee's salary ranked compared to others and how their salary changed over time, comparing their current salary to their previous and next ones.  Finally, I used a common table expression (CTE), which is like creating a temporary table for a specific query, to find out how many male employees had their highest salary below the average salary of the entire company.

Essentially, this project was all about uncovering insights from the employee data, using a variety of SQL techniques to answer different questions about the workforce.  It was about taking raw data and turning it into a story about the company's employees.
